Greece is considered the cradle of Western civilization, 
being the birthplace of democracy, Western philosophy, 
Western literature, historiography, political science, 
major scientific and mathematical principles, 
Western drama and the Olympic Games. 
From the eighth century B.C., the Greeks were organised 
into various independent city-states, known as poleis (singular polis), 
which spanned the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Philip II of Macedon 
united most of present-day Greece in the fourth century B.C., 
with his son Alexander the Great rapidly conquering much of 
the ancient world, from the eastern Mediterranean to India. 
The subsequent Hellenistic period saw the height of Greek 
culture and influence in antiquity.
